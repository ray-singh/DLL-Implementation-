# Doubly Linked List Implementation

This project provides an implementation of a doubly linked list (DLL) in Python. A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields: a value and references to the next and previous nodes in the sequence. This particular implementation also includes a child attribute for each node, which can be used for more complex data structures or problems, such as the dream_escaper function.
